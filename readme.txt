Manages multiple sports team schedules and scoreboards. Displays schedule tables, schedule sliders, scoreboards, and countdown timers.

== Description ==

The MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards plugin manages multiple sports team schedules and scoreboards. A variety of shortcodes and widgets are available to display schedule tables, schedule sliders, scoreboards, and countdown timers. A robust set of display settings is available through the admin screens to customize these displays. Displays may be further customized via the plugin's stylesheet. 

= NEW IN MSTW SCHEDULES & SCOREBOARDS =

The MSTW Schedules & Scoreboards replaces (MSTW) Game Schedules and Game Locations plugins. All users, especially users of the (MSTW) Game Schedules and Game Locations plugins, are encouraged to review [What's New in Schedules & Scoreboards](http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/ss-whats-new/) before getting started.

Version 1.2 adds a scoreboard 'ticker' - a slider of games & scores intended for the top of pages. It also adds a Scoreboard Settings tab to the plugin's Settings admin screen. CSV Import of games was updated to support hand-entered schedules; in particular, man-readable game dates & times instead of computer generated Unix timestamps (as generated by MSTW CSV Export). 

= Notes =
The MSTW Schedules & Scoreboard plugin is part of the My Sports Team Website (MSTW) framework for sports team and league websites. Others include Team Rosters, Coaching Staffs, League Standings, MSTW CSV Exporter, and Game Locations and Game Schedules (both now deprecated). All are available on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins). [Learn more about MSTW](http://shoalsummitsolutions.com/my-sports-team-website/).
